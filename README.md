### Tuts+ Tutorial: [PostCSS Deep Dive: Miscellaneous Goodies](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/postcss-deep-dive-miscellaneous-goodies--cms-24603)
#### Instructor: Kezz Bracey

Throughout this series we’ve been through many different categories of PostCSS plugins, offering all kinds of different advantages for your CSS development. But some of the very best PostCSS plugins don’t fit into the categories we’ve covered in our previous series entries.

In this tutorial you’re going to learn about five of these “miscellaneous goodies”. We’ll cover:

- Generating grids with Lost
- Seeing how your designs look to colorblind people with postcss-colorblind
- Converting px units to rem with postcss-pxtorem
- Auto-generating an RTL version of your stylesheet with rtlcss
- Auto-generating a style guide with postcss-style-guide
